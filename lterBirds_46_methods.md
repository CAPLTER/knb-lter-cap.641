CAP LTER BIRDING POINT COUNT PROTOCOL Revised December 2014

### POINT COUNTS

A point count consists of one person standing in a specific location for
a fixed length of time at a specific time of day, and counting all birds
seen and/or heard within a specific distance ("Fixed Radius") or as far
as the eye can see ("Open Radius.")

-   CAP LTER uses 15-minute observation periods
-   Counts are completed within 4 hours of local sunrise (see provided
    table for sunrise time)
-   Counts are done using the "Open Radius" method

### ADDITIONAL OBSERVERS

The primary observer may be accompanied to the point by an additional
observer. However,only the observations of the primary observer should
be recorded on the data sheet. To avoid any bias that would invalidate
the data collected, the secondary observer should not verbalize, point
out birds, or give any non-verbal cues to the primary observer (e.g.,
looking at a bird with binoculars is a non-verbal cue). The second
observer should position itself in order to minimize disturbance to
birds as well as to the primary observer. Ideally, the second observer
will stand near the primary observer and slowly move around or bend down
so that he/she does not obstruct the primary observer views.

-   Please note in the "Site Condition" section of the datasheet if an
    additional observer was present during the count.
-   If the secondary observer sees a species that the primary observer
    did not see, it may be noted in the "Notable additional bird
    species" section.

### COUNT CONDITIONS

-   The first point count should be started no earlier than
    local sunrise. The final point count should be finished no later
    than 4 hours past local sunrise.
-   Do not conduct point counts in steady or heavy rain, though it is
    acceptable to conduct counts in light, intermittent drizzle (be sure
    to make note of this in the "Precipitation" section of the
    data sheet).
-   Do not conduct point counts in steady winds above 20 mph (visual cue
    = branches of a moderate size move, small trees in leaves begin
    to sway). Make a note of the wind condition in the "Wind" section of
    the datasheet.
-   In the "Disturbance" section, note if yes or no any type of
    disturbance occurred during the count, and describe the disturbance
    under the "Site Condition" section of the datasheet. A disturbance
    may involve disturbing you, the observer (e.g., a homeowner came and
    talked to you), or disturbing the birds (e.g., a cat chasing birds,
    garbage truck making lots of noise and flushing birds, predator flew
    by and flushed birds, etc.).  
-   If YOU, the observer, are being disturbed during the 15-minute count
    period for any reason, make a note of the interruption in the "Site
    Condition" section. Time should be paused for the duration of the
    interruption and resumed once the interruption event is terminated.
    Redo the count entirely if you are unsure of the time you were
    disrupted for.
-   Make a note of the overall noise condition for the whole count
    period in the "Noise" section of the datasheet.

### APPROACHING THE POINT and FILLING TOP OF DATASHEET

-   Park your vehicle at &gt;40m from the bird point.
-   Approach the plot as quietly as possible to minimize disturbance to
    the birds present.
-   In the "Notable additional bird species" section, make note of any
    bird species flushed by the approach in case they do not return
    during the count.  
-   Under "Notable additional bird species", note bird species
    seen/heard before and/or after the count. Bird species recorded
    under this section are species NOT observed during the count but
    observed while at the site.
-   Stand quietly at plot center for 5 minutes before starting
    the count. This is essential to allow any disturbance caused by the
    approach to settle down.
-   Use this 5-minute settle-down time to fill out the information at
    the top of the datasheet, set up the noise meter, and find your
    distance brackets (5m, 10m, 20m, 40m) with the range finder. Note
    that the range finder MAY be in yards. If so, the conversion of
    yards to meters is: 5m = 5.4yrd; 10m = 10.9yrd; 20m = 21.9yrd; 40m
    = 43.7yrd.
-   Record in the "Site condition" section any unusual circumstances
    around the plot, such as construction activity or flooding, or
    anything you noticed that have changed since your last visit. Also
    note presence of water (or absence of it) at sites where water is
    typically present such as at the riparian sites (site code starting
    with "EE", "EN", "PE", or "PN").
-   Record "Site Obstruction" as the percent of the horizon view that is
    blocked by something within a 20-m radius of the point. Record this
    every visit, even if it does not appear to have changed since your
    last visit. Record in 5% increments.

### CONDUCTING THE COUNT

After the 5-minute settle-down period, set a watch or timer and conduct
the count for 15 minutes. Rotate slowly in place and record all birds
seen and/or heard. For each observation, note the following in the
appropriate column of the data sheet.

Species

-   the four-letter (English name) 54th AOU Supplement (2013) alpha
    codes if known (see bird list code provided), or write down the
    complete common name.
-   If the species cannot be positively identified, use the closest
    taxonomic affiliation (it is better to record something as "unknown"
    rather than guessing). Make sure you look at all the "unidentified"
    code options listed on the bird list code provided to pick the most
    appropriate code.

Number of Individuals and Distance

-   Usually, a single individual bird will be recorded per line.
-   Only record a number greater than one on a single line if birds of
    the same species are observed very close together, such as a flock
    or family group.
-   If a mixed flock is observed, put each species on a separate line
    and note in the "Notes" column that they were part of a mixed flock.
-   Record estimated flock sizes (e.g., "10-20" or "15+") only if you
    cannot count them all.
-   Write the number of individuals observed in the appropriate
    distance columns.
-   If a bird moves during the count, record only the distance at which
    it was first observed.  
-   Pay close attention to bird movement to avoid counting birds twice.
-   Birds such as hummingbirds should be recorded in the distance column
    if they are using the habitat (such as when they are
    observed foraging) even if they are not perched per say. However, if
    you see them just flying quickly by or chasing each other, then they
    should be recorded as FT.

Fly-Throughs (FT)

-   If a bird is seen flying through the count area below the tallest
    structure or vegetation, and not observed taking off or landing,
    record it in the "FT" column only, not in the distance columns.
-   See note above regarding when to record hummingbirds as FT.
-   High flying birds can be noted as a FT only if they are "aerial
    screeners" using the habitat, such as a hawk circling 100 feet
    overhead looking for food. Make a note if the aerial screener is
    flying higher than the tallest structure.
-   You may note in the "Site Condition" section any unusual fly-overs
    of birds NOT using the habitat, such as a flock of Pelicans flying
    above the city.

Seen (S) or Heard (H) Columns

-   Record with a check mark whether the bird was identified from
    sight (S) or sound (H), or both. Use caution with similar-sounding
    birds like Juncos and Chipping Sparrows, or with mimics and
    imitators, like Mockingbirds and Starlings.

Direction

-   Record the direction the bird was first observed or heard. This may
    mean recording a bird heard to the south (S) even though you were
    facing northwest (N/W) at the time.
-   Use the cardinal and mid-cardinal points of the compass (N, N/E, E,
    S/E, S, S/W, W, N/W) in this column.

### ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS

-   After the count is completed and before leaving the site, review
    your data sheet to ensure you have filled it correctly: make sure
    you have a count and distance for all observations, and that the top
    part of your datasheet is complete.
-   Record under "Notable additional bird species" section ONLY birds
    USING THE HABITAT. This section is to record bird species seen using
    the habitat, but not recorded during the count.
-   Under the "Site Condition" section, you may note species such as
    Cormorants or Pelicans flying high above but NOT using the habitat.
-   Record under "Non-bird species present" any non-bird species
    observed at the site or fresh signs of non-bird species (i.e.,
    coyote scat) at the site
-   Wear drab clothing and avoid bold patterns that might scare away
    some birds, or attract other ones.
-   During the count, do not "pish", "squeak", or use any other methods
    to encourage birds to show themselves. This would artificially
    inflate the bird densities recorded and invalidate the
    data collected. If you want to see a bird you had difficulty
    identifying, you can "pish" only after the count is completed.
-   Use the 15-minute count period effectively; do not spend precious
    time trying to identify a bird that is far enough so that a spotting
    scope would be necessary to identify the species.
-   Do not start or continue a count if personal safety is threatened in
    any way. Notify CAP LTER bird research group managers of any threat
    to safety encountered at a research plot.
-   If the full 15-minute point count survey cannot be completed
    entirely for any reasons (e.g. weather, time limits, safety, etc.),
    the count must be re-done entirely and completed at another time
    within the season survey window.

### DATA AND COMMUNICATION

-   To minimize errors, please review and complete your data sheets
    within a day or so after the survey, preferably the day of
    the survey. In between others, make sure you did not leave any blank
    spaces, review all the alpha codes (if uncertain of an alpha code,
    verify it with the bird list code provided or write the FULL common
    name), complete your notes and make them concise, and preform
    necessary research (listen to calls and/or look at different
    field guides) to fill in your uncertain identification(s)
    when possible. The datasheets must be clear and easy to read to
    facilitate data entry and prevent errors.
-   All completed datasheets (reviewed for errors) must be returned to
    ASU within two weeks of the last survey completed during
    that season.
-   To facilitate communication and to aid the supervisor in tracking
    project progress and scheduling, make at least one entry per week on
    the google+ project resource page – be sure particularly to note if
    you surveyed all your assigned sites for the week or if you missed
    some (specify which ones), report interesting/unusual sightings and
    specify where you saw them, and report any problems (i.e., site
    access issues, road closures, safety concerns, scheduling
    issues, etc).
